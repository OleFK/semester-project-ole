                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our</p>
                <p>origins. Where do we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin</p>
                <p>proposed his the ory of evolution we have had a framework for exploring and</p>
                <p>understanding our place in this world.</p>

                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we know today </p>
                <p>have evolved our time. You can also take some time to meet a few of the </p>
                <p>creatures who didn't survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a</p>
                <p>number of dinosaurs too.</p>
