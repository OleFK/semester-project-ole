                <div class="read-ex">
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the
                question of our origins. Where do we come from and how did we get
                here? Since Darwin proposed his the ory of evolution we have had a
                framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="read-ex">
                <p>Discover the origins of life on this planet and how the species we
                know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
                meet a few of the creatures who didn't survive, including our
                Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a number of dinosaurs too.</p>

                <div class="read-ex">
                    <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in
                    biology are offering us unique insights into the great wonders of the
                    tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much longer and
                    their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our
                    understanding of medicine.</p>

                    <div class="read-ex">
                    <p>Over series of exhibits we explore the
                    history of medicine and take a look at some major breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant.
                    Many of our great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the
                    lab, but also from observing animals in the wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.</p>

                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, 
                "The Sky Above Us", explores the night sky and
                what we can see and know about the universe around us.
                We'll locate the various constellations and galaxies that
                can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who
                used the stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our 
                solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to Galileo's
                telescope, to the latest exploration 
                of the planets in our solar system</p>

                    <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the
                    planet, the more important it becomes that scientists explore how to
                    create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the whole
                    planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the
                    dangers we currently face including global warming, extinction of
                    species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.</p>

            <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam,
            the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Science
            Museum. It's a series of installations that allow visitors to
            experience the power of the elements as we harness
            them. From solar energy powering lighting, to
            'Wind Island' that shows how turbines are able to
            use and control wind to create power.</p>
