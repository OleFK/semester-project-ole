        <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <div class="contri-text">
        <p>A number of people volunteer their time and effort to</p>
        <p>keep the displays in good order and ready for visitors</p>
        <p>to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks</p>
        <p>including getting to see behind the scenes of a</p>
        <p>working museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a</p>
        <p>monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come</p>
        <p>together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and</p>
        <p>strategies for the museum.</p>
        <p>You can help volunteer in a number of different</p>
        <p>spheres. Please contact us if you'd like to find out</p>
        <p>more about how you can get involved.</p>
